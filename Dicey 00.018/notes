added:
dice
card, "puting card into gun", using card in your gun
hud that can shuffle cards


More of a devlog:
* raycasting had a problem, it was a list with all collision sorted by x position of a global (0,0), now it is a
  sorted by distance to muzzle list, raycasting works as it should
* new sprite class for collision help
* hud inventory updating and bliting only when it has a permission
* making a raycast global calculations and local visualization of it. blitin' a visualization into big gun surface to have it all
  in one sprite





TO DO:
when cards are in hud they are not updating, they behaving like images
puting cards from hud into gun
